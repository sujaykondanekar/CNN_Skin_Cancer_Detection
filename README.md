#  A model based on Convolution neural network to accurately detect melanoma
Build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

## Solution 
Attempted mutiple models, with and without dropout layers, with and without augmentation strategies with various epoch's

## Conclusions

Final model has an training accuracy of 88.68% with validation accuracy of 82.77%
The agumentor used to balance the classes helped improve the validation accuracy.
The model is able to predict an image correctly. The model no longer shows signs of under or over fit.
